### Within the Options menu:

The ranges must be set from midnight to midnight. (00H00 - 00H00)
A range that has the same billing must have the same name so that HA can perform the sum.
On each beach, it is necessary to add an hourly rate

Example :
My contract stipulates off-peak hours from 01H30 to 08H00 and from 12H30 to 14H30.

The following ranges should be defined:

    Peak hours 00H00 01H30 0.12
    Off-peak hours 01H00 08H00 0.08
    Peak hours 08H00 12:30 0.12
    Off-peak hours 12H30 14H00 0.08
    Peak hours 14H00 00H00 0.12
